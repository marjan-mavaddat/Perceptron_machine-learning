# Perceptron_machine-learning
Along with this text, a file called txt.data is provided to you. This file contains useful data from the information of about 2 suspected patients
It is called coronary artery disease. This file is actually a table, each row of which represents a member of the collection
The patients studied and each column represent a specific feature. These features are named according to the table below
have became.

age, Ischemia, Diastolic.function, E, A, Grade, E.A, e, a, and e.a.

The features that are underlined are the features that will be considered in this project or in future projects. Quantities
The columns E, A, e and a are the values ​​measured by the echocardiogram.

A) Histogram (Histogram) Draw the data in columns E, A, e and a.
(outlier (delete? delete outdated data. To do this, the entire line containing the outdated data must be deleted.
Columns a must all be less than 2.0. Remove rows with attribute values ​​a greater than 2.0.)

B) Draw a plot scatter diagram with two properties A and E. The horizontal axis for the variable A The vertical axis for the variable
Consider e. Show examples from each class in a different color. The class of each variable is expressed according to the Ischemia feature
Includes two labels POS and NEG. The POS tag means that the person in the database has a heart condition and the NEG
This means that the person in question does not have a heart complication.

C) Select about 3% of the samples completely randomly. This set of examples is called the Set Train.
This collection does not change in any way after creation. This set will be used to teach the perceptron Average algorithm in this section
became. The other samples form a set test. This set of samples will have no participation in the training and only
Will be used to evaluate the performance of the training algorithm. Perceptron Average algorithm on instruction set instruction, instruction
And after each step of the training (Iteration) draw the categorization error according to the desired iteration.
Take. The resulting diagram is called a convergence diagram. (A practical point: it is better to arrange the training samples in each repetition
Completely by accident and the so-called training data is cut in each repetition).

D) After the end of the algorithm, calculate the error in practice (empirical error) as a set of training and experiments.

E) Draw the plot Scatter curve in the previous case with a separating superplate on a diagram. Note that in this case
plot Scatter is drawn using training examples.

C) Draw the plot scatter curve along with the separating superplate on a diagram. In this case, plot Scatter using samples
Experiment drawing.

G) Repeat steps "t", "s" and "c" in the case where the value of repetition is equal to.. How the results are obtained from this
Do you justify the preposition and the preposition according to the concepts of the lesson, such as "bias-variance compromise", "overrun" and "optimal Bayesian error"?

H) Based on the results you have obtained, how promising is the performance of the classifier designed to diagnose this type of heart complication?
You are
